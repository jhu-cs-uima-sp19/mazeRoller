*Maze Roller - A Gaming Experience*

Maze Roller is a unique puzzle game that involves navigating a ball through a maze by tilting your device to simulate gravity acting on the ball. 

The features that we have completed so far include: 
- General Navigation
- Level Selection from 3 unique levels of varying difficulty and aesthetic
- Movement of ball around maze due to gravity
- Pausing, level failure, and level success, with relevant actions from each result
- Collection of stars and tracking of level completion time
- Adjustment of control sensitivity from settings

In its current state, our application is fairly functional and can be played as a standalone game. With its flexible design, it can be readily expanded to include more levels of various difficulties, colors, etc. 
In the near future, we would like to finish our development of a database for a leaderboard of top completion times for each level to make our game more competitive; setting up Firebase gave us a little bit of trouble this time around. We would also like to finish implementing our alternative control scheme using a virtual joystick, as well as allow the user to "center" gravity around a particular axis, so that they can play the game while holding the device in different orientations or correct for inaccuracies.
